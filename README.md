# Jordan Christensen Portfolio Website

As a 13 year old kid, my dream was to make my own website. Not because I had anything to sell or something to say, I just wanted one for the challenge. I tried using a website building service, but I wasn't satisfied; it had limited customization and watermarks everywhere. This led to 13 year old me learning the very basics of HTML and CSS. While it wasnâ€™t a difficult task, I was able to create the first project that I felt satisfied and proud of.

Years later, I may not be creating websites, but I still have the same passion that I did as a 13 year old kid. I made this portfolio not because I have anything to sell or something to say, but because I accept the challenge.
