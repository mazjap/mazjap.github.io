# Jordan Christensen Portfolio Website

As a 13 year old, I dreamed of creating my own website. Not because I had something to sell or say, I just wanted one for the challenge. I tried using a website building service, but it's limited customization and watermarks drove me to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. While it wasnâ€™t the most difficult task, I was able to create my first website and in turn a project that I was satisfied and proud of. Years later, I may not be creating websites, but I still have the same passion that I did as a 13 year old kid.
